# More More Lang

## Introduction

Tired of seeing item names only in your current game language? The **More More Lang** solves this by injecting the names of items, blocks, and fluids from any language you choose directly into their tooltips.

This mod is essential for players who frequently interact with multi-lingual communities, share screenshots, or simply want to know the "standard" name used in another language (like English, even if they play in Japanese).

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Multi-Language Display:** Configure and display the translated names for items in *any number* of languages simultaneously.
*   **Arbitrary Selection:** You are not limited to just one secondary language; select the specific language codes you want to see (e.g., both `es_es` and `zh_cn`).
*   **Seamless Integration:** The localized names are cleanly displayed beneath the standard name in the item's tooltip.
*   **Jade Compatibility:** Full and robust compatibility with the [Jade](https://github.com/Snownee/Jade) mod, ensuring that the localized names appear correctly within the advanced tooltip interface.
*   **Lightweight:** Designed to be highly performant with minimal impact on game load times.

## ⚙️ Configuration

The list of languages to display is set via the mod's configuration file, typically found at `config/MoreMoreLang.toml`

### Configuration Example

You need to provide a list of ISO language codes (e.g., `en_us`, `ja_jp`, `zh_cn`, `fr_fr`).
